\section{Introduction and Motivation}

Planktonic biomass forms the fundamental food source for consumers at
higher trophic levels. They play a significant role in producing more
than $50\%$ of the global oxygen supply. Hence, studying their
community structure, abundance, and dispersion across the ocean is a
primary research concern. To avoid transferring planktonic organisms
to the lab or applying ship-based point profiling as traditional
approaches suggest, our project, \proj (\textbf{A}utonomous
\textbf{I}maging and \textbf{L}earning \textbf{A}i \textbf{RO}bot
identifying pla\textbf{N}kton taxa in-situ), has designed, built and
is testing an open source autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)
framework that images, identifies, and measures targeted plankton
spatial spread in-situ, akin to a ``sniffer dog''. When operational, a
researchers can specify a search area, a set of plankton taxa of
interest and launch the AUV from shore for it to explore the upper
water column for these precise taxa. The AUV performs an initial
search over the area and adaptively maps the targeted biology over
time. % At the end of the day the AUV returns to
% shore where it remotely is controlled in and picked up.

In this paper we present the adaptive sampling algorithm and the
simulation results associated with the hydro-dynamic flow, which based
on input from the on board imaging and deep learning classification
module and performs data processing using Gaussian Process (GP)
regression combined with a 4D current model and uses the estimated
spatial distribution to perform trajectory generation. 

%\section{Motivation}

\section{Related Work}

In \cite{fossum18b} an AUV adaptivly measures Chlorophyll to estimate
biomass 3D spatial structure, based on GP regression. \cite{das15}
used adaptive sampling to determine when optimally to take water
samples with an AUV.  However both assume the sample time-span is
short enough for the temporal movement of the biomass caused by the
current to be ignored as noise.  \cite{smith10} uses an ocean model
prediction to plan glider paths to optimally sample algae patches, but
does not adaptivly update the path during the search.  Incorporating
the current structure into the adaptive sampling is ambitious, but
numerical ocean models provide more accurate forecasts and small and
improved acoustic sensors allows AUVs to directly measure local
current profiles \cite{Fong2006, Cusi2017}.

Our work is unique in that, it combines some of these ideas, into an
integrated vehicle for scientific exploration, combining machine
vision, machine learning, hydro-dynamic flow modeling and an automated
planning/execution framework, all embedded on a powered AUV platform.

The overall data/control flow can be seen in
\cref{fig:sensePlanActLoop}. Communication with human experts, choice
of objective function for the trajectory planner and resolution of the
on board spatio-temporal biomass model are governed by an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) based deliberative planner, which continuously
controls the trajectory and the biomass model during execution. When
plan generation and execution embedded on a robot is continuous,
sensing of the robots environment updates the internal representations
which could modify future actions with plan synthesis and in turn
future actions \cite{rajan12}.  In enabling this continuous
\textbf{sense}, \textbf{plan} and \textbf{act} loop, the robot can
adapt to changing conditions in the real world enabling a cognitive
capacity that most robotic vehicles to date, fall short of.

  for further exploration is found. The AUV will then start executing
  the plan, and thus gather new measurements which continuously update
  the partial plan.}

\subsection{Particle detection-classification pipeline}

In our AUV, a novel imaging camera \cite{Davies2017a} based on a
transmittance imaging system, is embedded into the hull of the
AUV. This onboard imaging enables in-situ time-series capture of
magnified images of particles floating through an installed volume of
\SI{55}{\micro\meter} diameter while taking into account spatial and
temporal variations in particle properties.

This stream of captured images is, in turn, input to object detection
and classification pipeline that uses deep machine learning (DL)
approaches. The pipeline line starts with extracting and identifying
the set of objects per image frame in the time-series. Then extracted
objects are input to a classification module for further taxa
identification and recognition by means of an embedded DL
architecture.

We did a thorough performance comparison between state-of-the-art DL
architectures. Our selection criteria demanded the use of a simple
5-convolutional-layer network since it outperforms the other DL
structures in terms of prediction speed, detection accuracy, and space
in the memory. The accuracy achieved after training the network over a
dataset of 7800 different images of planktonic organisms was $95.09\%$
compared to $93.54\%$,$93.54\%$, $91.98\%$, $92.24\%$, $91.21\%$, and
$82.68\%$ achieved by Zooplanktonet \cite{dai2016zooplanktonet},
VGGNet \cite{simonyan2014very}, ResNeXt \cite{xie2017aggregated},
ResNet \cite{he2016deep}, AlexNet \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} and
GoogleNet \cite{szegedy2015going} respectively.

%The novel SILCAM has been implemented into the hull of an AUV.
%It continuously captures magnified images of particles floating trough its capture volume.
%The raw images are processed and classified by a state-of-the-art deep learning model on-board the AUV, resulting in a stream of detected particle classes along with prediction confidences.
The chosen network architecture implemented for classification, in
turn, predicts and interprets planktonic objects extracted from the
time-series input raw images. Measurements of the different classes
concentration, along with their corresponding variances, are inferred,
and they are provided as an output of this process.
%For now we only consider one feature at a time, i.e. the total concentration of particles, but extending the system to multiple classes is possible.
%Also other observable processes then microbial biology could be monitored with the same system.

\subsection{Spatio-Temporal modelling}
%As the spatial density of microbiology is not stationary, but changes over time we model it as spatio-temporal process.
To enable mapping microbiological processes over time as they float in
the upper water-column, a local current model is used to predict the
advection of the biomass. Gaussian Process Regression/Kriging is
used to estimate a dense spatial distribution of the biomass.

\paragraph{Local Current Model}
Represented as a 4D (space and time) vector field over the operational
area of the AUV, it is either generated prior to missions based on a
numerical hydrodynamic model
%SINMOD \cite{slagstad2005}
or accumulated during the mission from acoustic doppler current
profiler (ADCP) measurements on the AUV.  A Lagrangian particle
transport model \cite{Rye2006}, is run onboard the vehicle.  Particles
are transported individually, using a variable-time step
integrator %\cite{Dormand1980}
through the current field, applying a random walk with the local
diffusivity.

\paragraph{Gaussian Process Regression} 
Gaussian Process Regression is performed over the particles to estimate the spatial structure of the microbiology concentrations.
%Gaussian process regression is data driven and requires very few parameters, which is important as the process observed is little known, making it hard to fit a parameter based model.
In addition to estimating the mean predicted values (the Kriging surface)
Gaussian Process regression also estimates the uncertainty, which is
later used to balance exploration vs exploitation when deliberating
where the AUV should go next.

%(\cmt{Cite. This is confusing; are you using a GP with the hydro-dynamic flow? I suspect what you want to say is, once a hot-spot has been identified, then to understand its spatial structure (size, extant and potentially as a result, the community (of the micro-organism) structure), one needs to do a GP (a la, work in Runde). Right?})
\subsection{Path Generation with Heuristics}
The goal is to find the path which maximises an objective function
based on the estimated GP model.  However allowing any kind of path
requires evaluation of the objective function. The search is made
efficient by utilising traditional survey paths as heuristics. E.g the
standard square survey shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:munkholmen} is
parameterised by the covered rectangle and its density, which is
significantly fewer parameters to optimise compared to specifying each
line individually.
%Bresenham's line algorithm

The objective function is calculated over the estimated GP model along
the path candidate. It is based on a combination of the following
interests:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Scientific interest in particular plankton classes. 
    \item Exploitation: maximization of expected measured concentration per travelled distance
      according to the kriging surface. 
    \item Exploration: minimizing model variance per travelled distance by sampling from
      previously little visited areas.
    \item Lagrangian Tracking: Follow the biomass by following the estimated current.
\end{itemize}
%(\cmt{This is very abrupt. You want to say where the GP is being used, but after you talk about the plan-exec, since it is the plan-exec component which determines when to activate the GP and modify the kernel. There should be a nice flow between when you introduce the GP with the rest of the para's below. And after Plan/Exec.}).
All code is open source and based on open source projects. Including
the AUV control and navigation software (DUNE) and mission control
(Neptus)\cite{pinto2013lsts}.

\section{Experimental Results}

The system is being tested and developed in simulations and on past
data.  The simulator is based on a numeric hydrodynamic model and is
overall very similar to the estimation system on board the AUV, only
larger scale.  GP kernels, learned from historic data, are used to
draw new simulated biomass which the simulated AUV draws measurements
from.  Fig.~\ref{fig:munkholmen} shows the planned path based on
historic data from a survey in Trondheim fjord, Norway in April 2020,
during an annual algae bloom. The planned path is maximising the
expected concentration of detected algae, while also minimising the
variance of the estimated Gaussian process.  \cref{fig:Simulation}
shows a larger simulation run from the same area, where the initial
biomass concentration were extrapolated from the historic data.
